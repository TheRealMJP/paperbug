Two part presentation covering techniques and optimizations used in the FSR1 algorithm, as well as the integration experience into Unity's HDRP.

Note that FSR1 is superseded by [FSR2](https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/announcing-and-first-look-at-amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-2-0/ba-p/516395), with the primary disadvantage of FSR1 being that the input image needs to be anti-aliased already.
